# Rotorflight Reference Design F7A

Please read the page [Rotorflight FC Design Requirements](FC-Design-Requirements.md) first.
It is explaining the generic requirements for all Rotorflight FC designs.

Lots of effort has been put into these designs for making sure they are as flexible as possible, while not imposing any hardware limitations on the functionality. The manufacturer can choose not to implement any features that are marked _optional_. All other features must be implemented.

The reference designs are considering only the aspects that have effect on the software support, mostly the STM32 resource allocation and the minimum set of supported features. The rest - like size, form factor, connector locations - are left for the manufacturer to decide.

The F7A design is for the STM32F722RET (64 pins LQFP) chip.


## Variants

The design F7A has two variants, depending on the chosen port combinations.

## Ports

### Servo and Motor Port

The servos and motors are connected to standard 0.1" pin headers.
The pin headers are organised as two blocks, of size 4x3 and 3x3 pins.

The cyclic servos and the tail servo/ESC connect to the 4x3 block.

The main ESC connects to the 3x3 block.

A receiver can be connected to the 3x3 block in some configurations.

All pin headers in these blocks have a common GND and a common VX (BEC power).

| Label    | Pin1 | Pin2 | Pin3 | MCU Pin |
| -------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ------- |
| S1       | GND  | VX   | PWM  | PB4     |
| S2       | GND  | VX   | PWM  | PB5     |
| S3       | GND  | VX   | PWM  | PB0     |
| TAIL     | GND  | VX   | PWM  | PB3     |
|          |      |      |      |         |
| ESC      | GND  | VX   | SIG  | PB6     |
| RPM      | GND  | VX   | SIG  | PA2     |
| SBUS     | GND  | VX   | SIG  | PA3     |

The ESC pin headers are designed to accommodate all variations of traditional and drone ESCs.
The following combinations are possible:

| Type                  | ESC Header     | RPM Header    | SBUS Header   | Example ESC                     |
| --------------------- | -------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Large heli ESC        | PWM + BEC      | RPM + BEC     | Telem + BEC   | Hobbywing Platinum V4 120A      |
| Small heli ESC        | PWM + BEC      | RPM + BEC     | S.BUS⁶        | Hobbywing Platinum V3 50A       |
| AM32 ESC              | DShot          | BEC.          | Telemetry     | IFlight BLITZ E80               |
| BlueJay ESC           | DShot          | BEC           | S.BUS⁶        | Holybro 20A                     |

A one-wire receiver can be connected to the SBUS header, if the ESC Telemetry feature is not in use.
The receiver must be high voltage capable, e.g. the BEC voltage.
